=head1 DESCRIPTION
                                                              
This module is to save the developers to type the same code of accessor     
day in and day out.                                           

There are two non-exclusive ways to generate the accessors for a module.    
                                                              
=over                                                         
                                                              
=item 1 using import method                                   
                                                              
'import' method is special for Perl module.                   
It is called when the module get used, like Exporter.         
And the arguments listed behind the module name are passed into import method.
                                                              
This import method requests a hash with limited keys as '$', '@'. 
The values in the argument hash are the array reference.
